Workflow analysis, validation, and reporting optimization for interpreter request processes in a healthcare intake setting.

# Interpreter Workflow & Cost‑Effectiveness Project

This repository documents a real-world operational improvement initiative focused on interpreter request workflows during patient check-in. The project was developed within the Client Insight Lab and includes structured problem framing, workflow analysis, and validation visuals.

##  Project Overview

During patient intake, staff often request interpreters inconsistently — either too early, too late, or when not needed. These inefficiencies lead to increased costs, workflow delays, and patient dissatisfaction. This project analyzes the intake workflow and proposes a data-driven, cost-effective solution.

##  Problem Framing Summary

- **Who**: Front desk staff, interpreter services, operations leadership  
- **What**: Inconsistent interpreter requests during patient check-in  
- **Where**: Intake desk, Jira documentation, interpreter services  
- **When**: During initial patient intake and peak hours  
- **Why**: Lack of standardized decision-making workflow  

##  Included Visuals

This repository includes four key visuals that represent the core workflow and validation logic:

- **Intake Form Mockshot**  
- **Interpreter Intake Workflow Diagram**  
- **KAN‑11 — QA Checklist for Intake Workflow**  
- **KAN‑15 — QA Checklist for Dashboard Validation**
  These visuals illustrate the intake process, workflow logic, and validation steps used to ensure accuracy and consistency in interpreter-related data.

##  Included PDF Documentation
